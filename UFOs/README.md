# Module 11 Challenge: UFOs

## Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this challenge was to organize the UFO data that was given and to organize it within a dashboard that people can click around on. Functions had to be created for the data to be filtered on the table. Bootstrap and arrays were combined with filters to help allow people to click around the table. 

## Results: There were filters divided into 5 different categories, city name, state name, date, country name, and the shape of the UFO. The filters allowed people to search for a combination of a date and a UFO shape to get accurate results. (Example of this in result.png on GitHub)

## Summary: One of the biggest things wrong with this system is that there is only a limited amount of data and that there is not any new findings being added to it. I would try to recommend making an application in which new findings and data could be added to make it more up to date. Features like drop down menus could be added to help increase the functionality of the application overall. A clear button could also be added in order to clear all of the filters previously used.
